## Overview
A personal project I created to develop my Python coding skills inspired by my interest in baseball statistics. Utilized pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.offsetbox, and seaborn via a Kaggle notebook.

### Data
Data for injured list (IL) use obtained from [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/roster-resource/injury-report?timeframe=all&groupby=all).

Data for MLB standings, strength of schecules, and win% obtained from [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB-standings.shtml).

## Summary of Projects

### Analysis of Injured List Use by Playoff and Non-Playoff Teams
Created a bar plot to analyze if postseason teams have fewer IL stints compared to all other teams.

### MLB Team Records vs Strength of Schedule
Created visualizations to plot MLB teams winning % vs. strength of schedule on the season for the MLB season through May 6 2023. Updated code one week later to see changes through May 12 2023. Updated once more after the full season.

### MLB Win% vs Opposing Team Records
Created a visualization to plot each MLB team's win% against teams with winning and losing records through May 12 for the 2023 season.
