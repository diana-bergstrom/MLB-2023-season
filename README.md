## Overview
A personal project I created to develop my Python coding skills inspired by my interest in baseball statistics. Utilized pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.offsetbox, and seaborn via a Kaggle notebook.

### Data
Data for MLB standings, strength of schecules, and win% obtained from [baseball reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB-standings.shtml).

## Summary of Projects
### MLB Team Records vs Strength of Schedule
Created visualizations to plot MLB teams winning % vs. strength of schedule on the season for the MLB season through May 6 2023. Updated code one week later to see changes through May 12 2023.
### MLB Win% vs Opposing Team Records
Created a visualization to plot each MLB team's win% against teams with winning and losing records through May 12 for the 2023 season.
