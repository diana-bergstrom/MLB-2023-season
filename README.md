## Overview
A personal project I created to develop my Python coding skills inspired by my interest in baseball statistics. Utilized pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.offsetbox, and seaborn via a Kaggle notebook.

### Data
Data for MLB standings, strength of schecules, and win% obtained from [baseball reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB-standings.shtml).
